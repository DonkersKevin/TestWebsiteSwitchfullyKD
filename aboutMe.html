            <h2>Hi</h2>
            <p>I'm Donkers Kevin, age 36.</p>
            <p>Currently living in Antwerp where I was born and raised. For the longest time I was employed in the horeca sector which is probably a big contributor to my appreciation of foodstuffs<p>
            <p>After a decade of back breaking labour I felt it time for a change and I've been studying to be a developer ever since.
            <p>Now with Switchfully, I'm finaly able to make the switch completely!
            <p>In my free time I enjoy playing videogames (who among the IT people don't...) and the occasional dive into the Warhammer lore with a good book or finding new dishes to try and cocktail to make.
            <p>(Also here's a bonus kitty)
